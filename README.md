Lecture Notes
These lecture notes were create through a crowd-sourcing effort during the semester I took this course.  They do a good job with screenshots and content; however, they do contain spoilers (answer to quizzes).  I reached out to the author to check if he would be OK with further additions if you someone from the class wants to do so.  Writing and reading these lecture notes helped me prepare for the midterm and final.
